        id="AnnotateVersionCheck"
        severity="Warning"
        message="This method should be annotated with `@ChecksSdkIntAtLeast(api=Build.VERSION_CODES.M)`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Annotate SDK_INT checks"
        explanation="Methods which perform `SDK_INT` version checks (or field constants which reflect the result of a version check) in libraries should be annotated with `@ChecksSdkIntAtLeast`. This makes it possible for lint to correctly check calls into the library later to correctly understand that problematic code which is wrapped within a call into this library is safe after all."
